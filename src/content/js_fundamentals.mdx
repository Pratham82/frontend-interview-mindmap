  <summary>1. How JS works and execution context?</summary>

  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1.25rem' }}>

At its core, **everything in JavaScript happens inside something called an _"execution context."_**  
You can think of this as a **big box or a container** where all your JavaScript code runs and is processed. This execution context is the complete environment for code execution.

This execution context has two main components:

### â€¢ Memory Component (also known as Variable Environment)

- This is one of the two crucial parts of the big box, dedicated to **storing data**.
- It's the specific place where **all your variables and functions are kept**.
- They are stored here as **"key-value pairs."** For example, a variable named `a` would have the value `10` associated with it.
- This component is also formally known as the **Variable Environment**, emphasizing that it's an environment for storing variables and functions.

### â€¢ Code Component (also known as Thread of Execution)

- This is the second vital part of the big box.
- This is where the **actual JavaScript code is executed**.
- The code is processed here **one line at a time**.
- This component is also known as the **Thread of Execution**, which describes how code proceeds: like a single, continuous thread working through instructions sequentially.

An important **core fundamental** concept is that **JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.**  
This characteristic dictates how JavaScript handles tasks and processes your code:

### ðŸ”¹ Single-threaded

JavaScript can only execute **one command at a time**.  
Imagine it like a single lane on a highway; only one task can pass through at any given moment. It does not perform multiple operations concurrently in its core execution.

### ðŸ”¹ Synchronous

JavaScript executes commands in a **specific and predetermined order**.  
It maintains a strict sequence: JavaScript **will not move on to the next line of code until the current line has completely finished executing**. This ensures that each operation is fully completed before the next begins, leading to a predictable, step-by-step flow of execution.

---

Therefore, the combination of _"synchronous single-threaded"_ means that JavaScript processes your code in a rigid, sequential mannerâ€”handling one instruction fully before proceeding to the next.  
While concepts like Ajax might suggest asynchronous behavior, the **fundamental execution model** is still synchronous and single-threaded.

> ðŸ’¡ **This understanding of the execution context is essential to mastering how JavaScript functions under the hood.**
