# Understanding Closures in JavaScript

Closures are functions that retain access to their lexical scope, even when executed outside of that scope.

## Example

```js
function outer() {
  const message = 'Hello from outer!'
  return function inner() {
    console.log(message)
  }
}

const greet = outer()
greet() // Hello from outer!
```
